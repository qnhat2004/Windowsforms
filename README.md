# Windowsforms 
This is my project winform C# when I learn the subject "Windows Programming"

# Guide
- Open the command promt at location you want, or you can click the `Search` -> type `cmd`

- Clone it to local of your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/qnhat2004/Windowsforms.git
```
- Open the solution file at each project in your IDE. Example, I choose the folder "Name and Age", in it I open file `WindowsFormsApp2.sln` by `Visual Studio`. Then you can run the project and view code of it.
